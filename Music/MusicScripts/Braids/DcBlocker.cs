    /// Several of Braids' models carry a large DC offset on purpose. A square at
    /// full TIMBRE is a 1% pulse, so it sits near the positive rail for the rest of
    /// the cycle; MORPH's filter and fuzz shift the whole wave; CSAW's notch is an
    /// offset by construction. On the module none of that reaches the outside world,
    /// because the output stage is capacitor-coupled.
    ///
    /// Unity has no such stage. Left in, the offset costs most of the headroom, and
    /// opening or closing the gate steps the speaker cone rather than starting a
    /// note. So the same one-pole high-pass goes here, at the end of the chain and
    /// after nothing else, which is where the hardware has it.
    ///
    /// Deliberately not in the fixed point: this is not part of Braids' arithmetic,
    /// it is the analogue stage after it, and at 12 Hz the coefficient has no useful
    /// fixed-point form anyway.
